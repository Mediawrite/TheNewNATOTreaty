# The New NATO Treaty

The new NATO treaty is a initiative of Mediawrite, a content agency in Bucharest. Romania. 

It aims to unite all military forces of humanity under one international military treaty, that aims to start the World War III (against death).


### Motivation
The project is a personal initiative and ment to be in honor of my ancestors who fought as dumb as shit mutherfuckers in World War I, World War II, and also in the Cold War as military technicians.
